# `.claude/` — Claude Code configuration

This directory is read first by Claude Code in the workspace root.

## Layout

```
.claude/
├── settings.json              # Permissions + hooks (typecheck after edit, block main commits)
├── commands/                  # 18 slash commands ready to use
├── memory/                    # Cross-agent shared learnings (49 universal feedbacks + index)
└── hookify-examples/          # 8 sample hookify rules — copy to .claude/ root and enable
```

## Memory

`.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` is the **router**. Each `feedback_*.md` is a single rule learned from a real mistake. Sessions read the index at startup and load specific files on demand. Add new entries via `/self-analysis` at session end.

## Slash commands

Each `commands/<name>.md` defines a `/` command callable in Claude Code. Highlights:

| Command            | What it does                                                |

## Hookify (optional)

If you install the [hookify](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins/tree/main/hookify) plugin, copy any of the files under `hookify-examples/` to `.claude/` (drop the `-examples/` segment) and enable them by setting `enabled: true` in their frontmatter.

The bundled rules:

- **block-force-push** — refuses `git push --force` and refspec `+`
- **block-git-stash** — refuses `git stash` (forces WIP commit instead)
- **block-no-verify** — refuses `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign`
- **block-pr-merge-admin** — refuses `gh pr merge --admin` (bypasses protection)
- **warn-checkout-new-branch** — warns when creating a branch from the wrong base
- **warn-commit-allow-empty** — warns about empty commits
- **warn-edit-public-locales** — warns when editing generated i18n artifacts
- **warn-git-commit-branch** — warns before committing on `main`

These hooks are independent of `settings.json` (which contains the always-on PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks and is more universal).
